- Replace te::VolumeAndPanPlugin with an extended version that adds stereo field controls.
  It is not clear if the plugin is added to tracks by default.
  If yes, replacing requires modifying the library code.
  Alternatives:
  - Delete the factory pugin and add a custom one on adding a new track.
  - Add the stereo processing as a separate plugin.
- Piano roll:
  - Juce has grid components.
  - How to implememnt drawing/selecting/etc tools with the support for keyboard shortcuts?
  - How to implement automation?
    - PPQ-based editing or curves by formulas (the latter may be incompatible with MIDI import/export)
