- Replace te::VolumeAndPanPlugin with an extended version that adds stereo 
  field controls.
  It is not clear if the plugin is added to tracks by default.
  If yes, replacing requires modifying the library code.
  Alternatives:
  - Delete the factory pugin and add a custom one on adding a new track.
  - Add the stereo processing as a separate plugin.
