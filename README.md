# StylerDAW
A loop-based DAW with patterns that respond to real time chord changes.

# To do:

- [] Implement basic DAW functionality (adding tracks, selecting inputs...)
- [] Implement musicality (based on tracktion engine's musicality code?)
- [] Implement a chord detector
- [] Implement a pattern player plugin
- [] Fit everything in a processing graph

- [] Custom engine using tracktion_graph? Should have less overhead compared to the tracktion_engine model.

# Requirements
- [___JUCE___](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) - 6.1.6 or above
- [___Tracktion_engine___](https://github.com/Tracktion/tracktion_engine) - develop - 1.2.0
